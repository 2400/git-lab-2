### Workflow Summary:

- Create a repository for every project
- Create a branch for every feature
- Create a pull request for the feature's branch
- Have your team review the pull request and comment on it
  - At this point the feature can be accepted, rejected, or recommended for modification
- Have a team member (other than the author) merge the pull request

**That's it. You just experienced the most common development workflow used today.**
